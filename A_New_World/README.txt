A New World — Minimal Wesnoth Add-on
====================================
What it is
----------
- A **Campaign** called “A New World” with one sandbox scenario on the New World map.

Install
-------
1) Extract this zip into your Wesnoth user data folder under `data/add-ons/` so you get:
   `.../data/add-ons/A_New_World/_main.cfg`
2) Launch Wesnoth (or press **F5** on the main menu to refresh).

Where to find it in-game
------------------------
- **Campaigns**: select “A New World”

Notes
-----
- Seven factions share the map; alliances are scripted through Lua so diplomacy can expand later.
- Everything is structured to be expanded later (more scenarios, custom units, events, etc.).
