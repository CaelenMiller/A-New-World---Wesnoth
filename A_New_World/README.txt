A New World — Minimal Wesnoth Add-on
====================================
What it is
----------
- A **Campaign** called “A New World” with a single scenario and a single map.
- A matching **Multiplayer** scenario that uses the exact same map (so all players must have this add-on).

Install
-------
1) Extract this zip into your Wesnoth user data folder under `data/add-ons/` so you get:
   `.../data/add-ons/A_New_World/_main.cfg`
2) Launch Wesnoth (or press **F5** on the main menu to refresh).

Where to find it in-game
------------------------
- **Campaigns**: select “A New World”
- **Multiplayer → Create → Scenarios**: select “ANW: Duel (Test Map)”

Notes
-----
- The campaign scenario is intentionally simple: move your Spearman, end your turn, you win.
- The MP scenario is just a test bed on the same map to confirm synchronization and that the add-on is required for all players.
- Everything is structured to be expanded later (more scenarios, custom units, events, etc.).
